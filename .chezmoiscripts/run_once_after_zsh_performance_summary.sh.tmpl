# Zsh Performance Optimization Summary
# This script documents all performance improvements made

echo "=== Zsh Performance Optimization Complete ==="
echo ""

echo "ðŸš€ Performance Improvements Implemented:"
echo ""

echo "1. âœ… Profiling Infrastructure Added"
echo "   - Added zmodload zsh/zprof for detailed profiling"
echo "   - Created performance test helper script"
echo ""

echo "2. âœ… Fixed Double Completion Initialization"
echo "   - Removed duplicate compinit call in brew.zsh"
echo "   - Centralized completion setup in .zshrc"
echo ""

echo "3. âœ… Smart Completion Caching"
echo "   - Only rebuild completion cache once per day"
echo "   - Use cached version for faster startup"
echo ""

echo "4. âœ… Optimized Plugin Loading"
echo "   - Enabled shallow clones (depth=1) for faster downloads"
echo "   - Added deferred loading for non-critical plugins"
echo "   - Configured load order caching"
echo ""

echo "5. âœ… Disabled Oh-My-Zsh Overhead"
echo "   - DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true"
echo "   - DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS=true"  
echo "   - DISABLE_COMPFIX=true"
echo "   - DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY=true"
echo ""

echo "6. âœ… Lazy Loading Implementation"
echo "   - NVM: Only loads when nvm/npm/node is used"
echo "   - Pyenv: Only loads when pyenv/python/pip is used"
echo "   - Anyenv: Only loads when anyenv is used"
echo "   - Goenv: Only loads when goenv is used"
echo "   - Heavy FZF functions: Load on first use"
echo ""

echo "7. âœ… Async Optimizations"
echo "   - Added zsh-autosuggestions with async mode"
echo "   - ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_USE_ASYNC=true"
echo "   - ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE=20"
echo "   - ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_MANUAL_REBIND=true"
echo ""

echo "8. âœ… Optimized Modular Loading"
echo "   - Reduced filesystem calls in config loading"
echo "   - Use glob expansion instead of loops"
echo "   - Added readability checks before sourcing"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š Testing Instructions:"
echo ""
echo "1. Enable profiling (uncomment lines in .zshrc):"
echo "   - Line 5: zmodload zsh/zprof"
echo "   - Line 157: zprof"
echo ""
echo "2. Measure startup time:"
echo "   time zsh -i -c exit"
echo ""
echo "3. Detailed profiling:"
echo "   ~/.zsh_profile_test"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results:"
echo "   - Target: Under 200ms startup time"
echo "   - Typical improvement: 50-80% faster startup"
echo "   - All functionality preserved with lazy loading"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ”§ To revert optimizations:"
echo "   - Comment out the DISABLE_* variables"
echo "   - Remove lazy loading functions"
echo "   - Restore original nvm/pyenv loading"
echo ""

echo "Performance optimization complete! ðŸŽ‰"
